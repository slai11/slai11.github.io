## About Me

I am Sylvester Chin. I currently work at GovTech as a Software Engineer. Also, I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at NUS in a part-time capacity. 

My area of interest include distributed systems, data compression techniques, how the computer works (OS, architecture, networking), application of machine learning to transport/healthcare/fraud and above all, building products that create a positive effect on the world we live in.
