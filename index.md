Hi I'm Sylvester, welcome to my blog. I try to organize them by category and update frequently. The posts are largely computer science related.

## About Me

I am Sylvester Chin. I currently work at GovTech as a Software Engineer. Also, I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at NUS in a part-time capacity. 

I'm highly interested in distributed systems, data compression techniques, how the computer works (OS, architecture, networking) and above all, building products that create a positive effect on the world we live in.

<!-- ## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/slai11/slai11.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/slai11/slai11.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
